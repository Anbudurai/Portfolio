ðŸŒŸ Project Highlights

Data Ingestion:

AWS S3: Set up buckets for raw and processed data. This helps in organizing and managing the data efficiently.

Data Processing:

AWS Lambda: Utilized Lambda functions to process the incoming data in real-time. Lambda's serverless nature ensures scalability and cost-efficiency.

Monitoring and Logging:
AWS CloudWatch: Implemented CloudWatch to monitor the pipeline's performance and log important events for debugging and optimization.

Security and Access Management:
AWS IAM Roles: Configured IAM roles to ensure secure access to S3 buckets and Lambda functions, maintaining stringent access controls.

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies:
AWS S3: For scalable storage solutions
AWS Lambda: For serverless data processing
AWS CloudWatch: For real-time monitoring and logging
AWS IAM: For secure and fine-grained access control

This project not only improved data processing efficiency but also ensured scalability and cost-effectiveness using AWS serverless technologies. 
I'm excited to continue exploring and building more data-driven solutions! ðŸ˜Š
